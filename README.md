# SDEV-325-Homework-2
In this assignment, I had to created two simple web applications using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Both web application were created to highlight a specific vulnerability and a possible mitigation technique. There are two versions of each web application, the one version demonstrates the vulnerability and the other demonstrates a mitigation techinuqe. The first vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting attack and the second vulnerability is Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type. In addition to the code I have screen captured and documented everything in a MS word file.
